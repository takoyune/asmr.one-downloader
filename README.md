## ✨ Features

### Download Engine
- **Async concurrent downloads** via `asyncio` + `aiohttp`. Configurable concurrency (default: 3 parallel files).
- **Resume support** — downloads use HTTP `Range` headers. A `.tmp` file is kept between sessions and extended on restart. No re-downloading from the beginning.
- **3-attempt retry loop** per file. After exhausting retries, the failure is recorded with its reason (HTTP status, exception type, or directory error) and displayed in the Session Report.
- **Token-bucket bandwidth limiter** — set `bandwidth_limit_mbps` in config to cap download speed globally. `0` means unlimited.
- **Mirror speed test on startup** — all configured API mirrors are pinged in parallel and the fastest is selected automatically.

### Library & Queue
- **SQLite library** (`history.db`) tracks every completed download: RJ code, title, local path, file size, date.
- **Duplicate detection** — before anything is queued, the app checks the library. Already-owned works are skipped with a notice.
- **Persistent queue** — the download queue lives in the database, not in memory. Interrupted sessions survive a restart. Use `--resume` to continue.
- **Format priority deduplication** — when a work includes both WAV and MP3 versions of the same track, only the preferred format (per your `format_priority` list) is downloaded.

### CLI & UI
- **`--list`** — print the full folder/file tree of any RJ code without downloading.
- **`--dry-run`** — simulate a download interactively: shows which files would be fetched and total size, writes nothing to disk.
- **`--all`** — skip the file-selection prompt and download everything.
- **`--batch`** — load a `.txt` file of RJ codes and queue them all.
- **Session Report** — after each job: success/fail/skipped counts, elapsed time, average speed, and a per-file failure details table when errors occurred.
- **Retry prompt** — at the end of a batch, any failed RJ codes are collected and you are offered a single-key retry.
- **Windows completion beep** — a system notification sound plays when the full queue finishes.

### Metadata & Organization
- **Audio tagging** (`mutagen`) — title, artist, album, and cover art are written to MP3, FLAC, and OGG files after download.
- **Flexible folder naming** — configurable `dir_template` using `{rj_id}`, `{title}`, `{circle}`, `{year}`.
- **Optional file sorting** — enable `sort_files` to separate downloads into `Audio/`, `Images/`, `Text/` subdirectories.

## 📦 Requirements

- **Python 3.10 or higher** — download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- A terminal with ANSI color support:
  - Windows: **Windows Terminal** (recommended), VS Code terminal, or PowerShell 7+
  - macOS/Linux: any modern terminal emulator
- **Git** (for cloning) — download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)

Python packages (installed automatically by `setup.bat` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`):

| Package | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `aiohttp` | Async HTTP client for downloads and API calls |
| `aiofiles` | Async file I/O for writing download chunks |
| `aiodns` | Custom DNS resolver (bypasses ISP-level blocking) |
| `rich` | Terminal UI — progress bars, tables, panels, color |
| `mutagen` | Audio metadata tagging (MP3, FLAC, OGG) |
| `pydantic` | Config validation and schema enforcement |
| `requests` | Used for synchronous GitHub update check |
| `packaging` | Version string parsing for update comparison |

---

## 🚀 Installation

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/takoyune/asmr.one-downloader.git
cd asmr.one-downloader
```

Or download the ZIP directly from GitHub:
1. Click the green **Code** button on the repository page
2. Select **Download ZIP**
3. Extract the ZIP to a folder of your choice
4. Open a terminal in that folder

### Step 2 — Install dependencies

**Option A: Automated (Windows)**

Run the provided setup script. It creates a virtual environment and installs all dependencies into it:

```bat
setup.bat
```

After it finishes, all future launches via `./asmr` will use the virtual environment automatically.

**Option B: Manual (Windows / Linux / macOS)**

If you prefer to manage your own environment:

```bash
# (Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Windows (CMD):
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# macOS / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3 — Verify the install

```bash
python main.py --version
```

You should see the current version printed. If you see a `ModuleNotFoundError`, re-run the install step or check that the correct virtual environment is active.

## ▶️ Running the App

### Windows

```powershell
./asmr              # Open interactive menu
./asmr RJ123456     # Download directly
./asmr --help       # All available flags
```

> CMD users: `asmr.bat` works the same way — just type `asmr RJ123456`

### Linux / macOS

An `asmr` shell launcher is already included in the repo. Just make it executable once after cloning:

```bash
chmod +x asmr
```

Then use it the exact same way as Windows:

```bash
./asmr                      # Open interactive menu
./asmr RJ123456             # Download directly
./asmr --list RJ123456      # Preview file tree without downloading
./asmr --dry-run RJ123456   # Simulate a download
./asmr --help               # All available flags
```

┃            by Takoyune                 ┃
┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 📚 Library: 3 works ━┛

[1] Download (RJ Codes)
[2] Batch Download from File
[3] Library Browser
[4] Queue Manager
[5] Settings
[6] Statistics Dashboard
[7] System Utilities
[X] Exit
```

#### [1] Download (RJ Codes)
Enter one or more RJ codes separated by spaces (e.g. `RJ123456 RJ654321`). The app fetches metadata, presents the full file tree, and lets you select specific files by number or range (e.g. `1 3-5 7`). Leave the selection blank to download everything.

#### [2] Batch Download from File
Enter the path to a `.txt` file with one RJ code per line. All codes are validated, checked against your library, and added to the queue. The queue then processes them in order.

```
# Example batch file (my_list.txt)
RJ01234567
RJ07654321
RJ00112233
```

#### [3] Library Browser
Search your local download history by title or circle name (partial matches supported). Shows the local folder path and file size for each result.

#### [4] Queue Manager
View all items currently in the queue (pending / active / error status). Add new codes, change download priority, or remove items before they start.

#### [5] Settings
Edit all configuration options interactively without touching `config.json` manually. Includes a `format_priority` list editor where you can add, remove, and reorder your preferred formats.

#### [6] Statistics Dashboard
Overview of your library: total works, total size on disk, queue length, and average work size.

#### [7] System Utilities
- **Cache Cleaner** — Scans for `.tmp` and `.asmr_selection.json` files. Shows a summary with sizes before asking for confirmation.
- **Network Diagnostics** — Tests all configured API mirrors and shows latency for each.
- **Mirror Selector** — Re-run the speed test and update the active mirror in config.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "All API mirrors are unreachable"
The startup mirror test failed for all mirrors. Check:
1. Your internet connection
2. Whether your ISP blocks the ASMR.ONE domains — try setting `dns` to `"1.1.1.1"` or `"8.8.8.8"` in `config.json`
3. If you need a proxy, set the `proxy` field in `config.json`

### Downloads hang or time out repeatedly
- Increase `timeout` in `config.json` (e.g. `120`)
- Reduce `max_concurrent` to `1` or `2` to reduce connection pressure
- Try a different DNS or enable a proxy

### Progress bar starts at wrong percentage on resume
This is a known visual issue. The bar is initialized from file size on disk, not the database state. The download is still resuming correctly from the correct byte offset — the visual will correct itself as data flows in.

### `singularity.log` is too noisy
By default, only `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR` messages are logged. The `--verbose` flag adds `DEBUG` output (every HTTP request, byte offsets, retry attempts). Only use `--verbose` when actively debugging.

### "Fatal error" on startup with a cryptic message
Check `singularity.log` for the full traceback. The log file is in the project root directory.

### Files are not being tagged after download
Ensure `tag_audio` is `true` in `config.json`. Tagging only applies to MP3, FLAC, and OGG files. WAV files are not tagged (the WAV format has no standard metadata container).
